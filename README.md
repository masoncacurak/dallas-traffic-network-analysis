# Project Title: Optimizing Urban Commute Efficiency Through Network Analysis of Dallas Traffic Flows 

### Team Members:

### Motivation and Problem Statement:
Effective traffic control is critical in cutting down congestion, time on the road, and pollution in city centrality. In this project we will analyze a real-world traffic dataset that is comprised of floating car data across thousands of road segments in Dallas, TX. We will model this dataset as a directed weighted transportation network where each road segment is an edge between intersections. In looking at Dallas’s traffic as a complex network, we will aim to identify key road segments and congestion communities with the goal of optimizing travel times. Note: As of now, we have not been able to find a sufficient dataset containing temporal data allowing us to center the project around optimizing commute duration based on the time of day. This work examines the questions: "How does traffic congestion spread through a network of highways.” "Which intersections are most critical for maintaining smooth traffic flow.” “Which road segments act as high centrality connectors that most effectively reduce overall commute times?" “Can we identify the main congestion bottlenecks in the traffic network based on the flow and speed data?”
